# Reflections on AI/ML Portfolio

Creating this portfolio has been a vital learning experience. By delving into various machine learning algorithms, I got deeper insights into how different models work and their applications across domains like tabular data, computer vision, NLP, and generative AI.

## Key Learnings

- **Generative AI Awareness:** Learning about GANs and diffusion models highlighted the innovative potential of AI in creative domains.
- **Visualization Skills:** Creating a visual infographic improved my ability to communicate complex technical concepts clearly and professionally.
- **Algorithm Categorization:** I can now clearly differentiate between supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms and identify which domains they are best suited for.
- **Practical Applications:** Understanding real-world examples, such as spam detection, image classification, and AI-generated content, helped solidify theoretical knowledge.

## Challenges and Insights
- Condensing complex algorithms into brief descriptions for the infographic necessitated significant consideration to provide clarity without oversimplification.
- Choosing the right color coding and layout for the infographic emphasized the significance of visual communication in technical portfolios.

## Overall Reflection
This project not only helped me better grasp AI/ML algorithms, but it also provided me with a professional artifact to demonstrate my abilities.  It has improved my capacity to communicate technical knowledge visually, which is an important skill in both academic and professional environments. Iteratively refine noise to create high-quality material.
