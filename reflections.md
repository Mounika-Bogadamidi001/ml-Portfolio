# Reflections on AI/ML Portfolio

Creating this portfolio has been a valuable learning experience. By exploring various machine learning algorithms, I gained deeper insights into how different models work and their applications across domains like tabular data, computer vision, NLP, and generative AI.

## Key Learnings
- **Algorithm Categorization:** I can now clearly differentiate between supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms and identify which domains they are best suited for.
- **Practical Applications:** Understanding real-world examples, such as spam detection, image classification, and AI-generated content, helped solidify theoretical knowledge.
- **Generative AI Awareness:** Learning about GANs and diffusion models highlighted the innovative potential of AI in creative domains.
- **Visualization Skills:** Creating a visual infographic improved my ability to communicate complex technical concepts clearly and professionally.

## Challenges and Insights
- Condensing complex algorithms into short descriptions for the infographic required careful thought to maintain clarity without oversimplifying.
- Choosing appropriate color coding and layout for the infographic reinforced the importance of visual communication in technical portfolios.

## Overall Reflection
This project not only strengthened my understanding of AI/ML algorithms but also gave me a professional artifact to showcase my skills. It has enhanced my ability to communicate technical knowledge visually, which is an essential skill for both academic and professional settings.
