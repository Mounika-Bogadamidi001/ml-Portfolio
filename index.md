## Algorithms Explained

### **Supervised Learning (Predictive Models with Labeled Data)**
- **Decision Tree:** divides data into branches according to characteristics in order to forecast results.  used to forecast customer attrition.
- **Random Forest:** Ensemble of decision trees increaing prediction accuracy. Example: Loan approval systems.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Finds a hyperplane that separates classes. Example: Spam email detection.
- **Linear Regression:** uses input features to predict numerical results. Example: Sales forecasting.

### **Unsupervised Learning (Discovering Patterns Without Labels)**
- **K-means Clustering:**assembles data points that are similar. Example: Customer segmentation.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** separates principal components from high-dimensional data. Example: Dimensionality reduction for visualization.

### **Computer Vision**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Find patterns in pictures to help with detection and classification. Example: Image classification tasks.

### **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Transformer Models (GPT/BERT):**For text generation, classification, and sequence modeling, employ attention mechanisms. Example: Chatbots, sentiment analysis.

### **Generative AI**
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Use a discriminator network and generator to produce realistic images or content. Example: AI-generated images.
- **Diffusion Models:** Use a generator and a discriminator network to make images or content that look real. Example: AI art generation.

## Learning Outcomes
By creating this portfolio, I have learned to:
- Communicate AI concepts visually and effectively.
- Showcase professional skills through a portfolio artifact.
- Categorize algorithms by type and domain.
- Understand practical applications for each algorithm.


This portfolio artifact shows both technical knowledge and the ability to create clear, visual appealing educational resources in AI/ML.
